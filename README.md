### Python Resources
* [Codecademy's Python course](http://www.codecademy.com/en/tracks/python): Good beginner material, including tons of in-browser exercises.
* [DataQuest](https://dataquest.io/): Similar interface to Codecademy, but focused on teaching Python in the context of data science.
* [Google's Python Class](https://developers.google.com/edu/python/): Slightly more advanced, including hours of useful lecture videos and downloadable exercises (with solutions).
* [A Crash Course in Python for Scientists](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/gist/rpmuller/5920182): Read through the Overview section for a quick introduction to Python.
* [Python for Informatics](http://www.pythonlearn.com/book.php): A very beginner-oriented book, with associated [slides](https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B7X1ycQalUnyal9yeUx3VW81VDg&usp=sharing) and [videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlRFEj9H3Oj4JXIwMwN1_ss1Tk8wZShEJ).
* [Beginner](code/00_python_beginner_workshop.py) and [intermediate](code/00_python_intermediate_workshop.py) workshop code: Useful for review and reference.
* [Python 2.7x Reference Guide](https://github.com/justmarkham/python-reference/blob/master/reference.py): Kevin's beginner-oriented guide that demonstrates a ton of Python concepts through short, well-commented examples.
* [Python Tutor](http://pythontutor.com/): Allows you to visualize the execution of Python code.

### Submission Forms
* [Feedback form](http://bit.ly/dat7feedback)
* [Homework and project submissions](http://bit.ly/dat7homework)

-----

### Class 1: Introduction to Data Science
* Welcome from General Assembly staff
* Course overview ([slides](slides/01_course_overview.pdf))
* Introduction to data science ([slides](slides/01_intro_to_data_science.pdf))
* Discuss the [course project](project/README.md)
* Types of data ([slides](slides/01_types_of_data.pdf)) and [public data sources](project/public_data.md)
* Wrap up: Slack tour, submission forms

**Homework:**
* Work through GA's friendly [command line tutorial](http://generalassembly.github.io/prework/command-line/#/) using Terminal (Linux/Mac) or Git Bash (Windows), and then browse through this [command line reference](code/02_command_line.md).
* Watch videos 1 through 8 (21 minutes) of [Introduction to Git and GitHub](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL5-da3qGB5IBLMp7LtN8Nc3Efd4hJq0kD).
* If your laptop has any setup issues, please work with us to resolve them by Wednesday.

**Resources:**
* For a useful look at the different types of data scientists, read [Analyzing the Analyzers](http://cdn.oreillystatic.com/oreilly/radarreport/0636920029014/Analyzing_the_Analyzers.pdf) (32 pages).
* For some thoughts on what it's like to be a data scientist, read these short posts from [Win-Vector](http://www.win-vector.com/blog/2012/09/on-being-a-data-scientist/) and [Datascope Analytics](http://datascopeanalytics.com/what-we-think/2014/07/31/six-qualities-of-a-great-data-scientist).
* Quora has a [data science topic FAQ](https://www.quora.com/Data-Science) with lots of interesting Q&A.
* Keep up with local data-related events through the Data Community DC [event calendar](http://www.datacommunitydc.org/calendar) or [weekly newsletter](http://www.datacommunitydc.org/newsletter).

### Class 2: Command Line and Version Control
* Command line exercise ([code](code/02_command_line.md))
* Git and GitHub ([slides](slides/02_git_github.pdf))
* Intermediate and advanced command line
* Wrap up: Course schedule, office hours

**Homework:**
* Using only the command line, discover something "interesting" about the Chipotle data. Create a Markdown document that includes your (brief) findings and the code you used. Add this file to a GitHub repo that you'll use for all of your coursework, and submit a link to your repo using the homework submission form.
* Review the code from the [beginner](code/00_python_beginner_workshop.py) and [intermediate](code/00_python_intermediate_workshop.py) Python workshops. If you don't feel comfortable with any of the content (up through the "dictionaries" section), you should spend some time this weekend practicing Python. Here are my recommended resources:
    * If you like learning from a book, [Python for Informatics](http://www.pythonlearn.com/html-270/) has useful chapters on strings, lists, and dictionaries.
    * If you prefer interactive exercises, try these lessons from [Codecademy](http://www.codecademy.com/en/tracks/python): "Python Lists and Dictionaries" and "A Day at the Supermarket".
    * If you have more time, try these much longer lessons from [DataQuest](https://dataquest.io/missions): "Find the US city with the lowest crime rate" and "Discover weather patterns in LA".
    * If you've already mastered these topics and want more of a challenge, try solving the second [Python Challenge](http://www.pythonchallenge.com/) and send me your code in Slack.
* If there are specific Python topics you want me to cover next week, send me a Slack message.

**Resources:**
* [Pro Git](http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2) is an excellent book for learning Git. Read the first two chapters to gain a deeper understanding of version control and basic commands.
* If you want to practice a lot of Git (and learn many more commands), [Git Immersion](http://gitimmersion.com/) looks promising.
* If you want to understand how to contribute on GitHub, you first have to understand [forks and pull requests](http://www.dataschool.io/simple-guide-to-forks-in-github-and-git/).
* [GitRef](http://gitref.org/) is my favorite reference guide for Git commands, and [Git quick reference for beginners](http://www.dataschool.io/git-quick-reference-for-beginners/) is a shorter guide with commands grouped by workflow.
* [Markdown Cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) provides a thorough set of Markdown examples with concise explanations. GitHub's [Mastering Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) is a simpler and more attractive guide, but is less comprehensive.
* If you want to go much deeper into the command line, [Data Science at the Command Line](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920032823.do) is a great book. The [companion website](http://datascienceatthecommandline.com/) provides installation instructions for a "data science toolbox" (a virtual machine with many more command line tools), as well as a long reference guide to popular command line tools.
* If you want to do more at the command line with CSV files, try out [csvkit](http://csvkit.readthedocs.org/), which can be installed via `pip`.
